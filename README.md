# zhavok
zhavok is a pure Zig library for parsing Havok tag files.

It is currently very WIP and not ready to use.

## Acknowledgements
Although it is not a direct port and does not include their code, zhavok is mostly based on the work of [HavokLib](https://github.com/PredatorCZ/HavokLib) and [hkxparse](https://github.com/exyorha/hkxparse). A huge thanks to those projects for the significant work they've done in reverse engineering the Havok formats. See the license section below for more information.
